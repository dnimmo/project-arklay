# project-arklay

Project Arklay is a simple text-adventure game that you can play by visiting http://project-arklay.com (although the version that is now in this repository is no longer the one that is served at that address - for that, see https://github.com/dnimmo/project-arklay-v2). This has been very much a spare time project, and work sporadically continues. If you have any thoughts, or find any issues, please feel free to get in touch: dnimmo@gmail.com
